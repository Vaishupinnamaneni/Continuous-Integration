Optimized Step-by-Step Approach to Set Up a CI Pipeline Using GitLab CI or Azure DevOps on Azure
Step 1: Prepare Your Development Environment
Azure Account and Permissions:

Ensure you have an Azure account with permissions to create and manage resources.
Install Necessary Tools:

Install Azure CLI, Git, and a code editor on your local machine.
Step 2: Choose Your CI Tool
Decide whether you will use GitLab CI or Azure DevOps for the CI pipeline setup. The steps below detail both options.
Option 1: Using GitLab CI
Step 3: Create and Configure Azure Resources
Create an Azure Virtual Machine (VM):

Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to create a VM to act as your deployment target.
Choose an appropriate image (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows), size (e.g., Standard B1s), and network settings.
Ensure the VM has inbound access on necessary ports (e.g., SSH for Linux, RDP for Windows).
Set Up Access Credentials:

Ensure you have SSH keys (for Linux) or the necessary login credentials (for Windows) to access the VM.
Step 4: Set Up GitLab Repository
Create a GitLab Repository:

Create a new repository in GitLab to host your project.
Add Your Project to GitLab:

Push your local project to the newly created GitLab repository.
Step 5: Define the GitLab CI Pipeline
Create a .gitlab-ci.yml File:

In the root of your GitLab repository, create a .gitlab-ci.yml file.
Define Pipeline Stages:

Build Stage:
Define steps to install dependencies and build your application.
Test Stage:
Define steps to run automated tests.
Deploy Stage:
Define steps to deploy the application to the Azure VM.
Configure Deployment to Azure VM:

Create SSH Keys and Add to GitLab CI/CD Settings:
Generate SSH keys and add the private key to GitLab CI/CD settings as a protected variable.
Add Public Key to Azure VM:
Add the public SSH key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the Azure VM.
Deployment Scripts:

Use SSH within your deployment scripts to transfer files and execute commands on the Azure VM.
Step 6: Set Up GitLab Webhooks
Configure Webhooks:
Set up webhooks in GitLab to trigger the CI pipeline on code pushes and merge requests.
Step 7: Commit and Push Changes
Commit Configuration Files:

Commit the .gitlab-ci.yml file and any other necessary scripts or configurations to your GitLab repository.
Push to Remote Repository:

Push your changes to the remote GitLab repository.
Step 8: Monitor the Pipeline
Run the CI Pipeline:
Monitor the pipeline execution in GitLab CI to ensure the build, test, and deploy stages run successfully.
Option 2: Using Azure DevOps
Step 3: Create and Configure Azure Resources
Create an Azure Virtual Machine (VM):

Use the Azure portal or Azure CLI to create a VM to act as your deployment target.
Choose an appropriate image (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows), size (e.g., Standard B1s), and network settings.
Ensure the VM has inbound access on necessary ports (e.g., SSH for Linux, RDP for Windows).
Set Up Access Credentials:

Ensure you have SSH keys (for Linux) or the necessary login credentials (for Windows) to access the VM.
Step 4: Set Up Azure DevOps Project
Create an Azure DevOps Organization:

If you donâ€™t already have one, create an Azure DevOps organization.
Create a New Project:

Create a new project in Azure DevOps.
Step 5: Define the Azure DevOps Pipeline
Set Up Repositories:

In Azure DevOps, create a repository for your project, or link an existing GitHub repository.
Create Azure Pipelines YAML File:

Create an azure-pipelines.yml file in the root of your project repository.
Define Pipeline Stages:

Build Stage:
Define steps to install dependencies and build your application.
Test Stage:
Define steps to run automated tests.
Deploy Stage:
Define steps to deploy the application to the Azure VM.
Configure Deployment to Azure VM:

Create SSH Keys and Add to Azure DevOps Pipeline Settings:
Generate SSH keys and add the private key to Azure DevOps pipeline variables as a secret.
Add Public Key to Azure VM:
Add the public SSH key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the Azure VM.
Deployment Scripts:
Use SSH within your pipeline scripts to transfer files and execute commands on the Azure VM.
Step 6: Configure Azure DevOps Triggers
Set Up Triggers:
Configure Azure DevOps to trigger the pipeline on code pushes, pull requests, and other relevant events.
Step 7: Commit and Push Changes
Commit Configuration Files:

Commit the azure-pipelines.yml file and any other necessary scripts or configurations to your Azure DevOps repository.
Push to Remote Repository:

Push your changes to the remote Azure DevOps repository.
Step 8: Monitor the Pipeline
Run the CI Pipeline:
Monitor the pipeline execution in Azure DevOps to ensure the build, test, and deploy stages run successfully.
Final Steps and Considerations
Documentation:

Document all setup steps, configurations, and scripts in your project repository for future reference.
Validate and Optimize:

Continuously monitor and optimize the pipeline for performance and reliability.
Address any issues or optimizations suggested by the pipeline logs and feedback.
By following these steps, you will establish an optimized CI pipeline using either GitLab CI or Azure DevOps on Azure, capable of handling competitive programming test cases efficiently.
