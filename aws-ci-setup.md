Optimized Step-by-Step Approach to Set Up a CI Pipeline Using Jenkins on AWS
Prepare Your Development Environment

Ensure you have an AWS account with sufficient permissions to create and manage resources.
Install necessary tools: AWS CLI, Git, Java (for Jenkins), and a code editor.
Set Up an EC2 Instance for Jenkins

Launch an EC2 Instance:
Choose an appropriate AMI (Amazon Machine Image), such as Amazon Linux 2.
Select an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for small-scale use).
Configure instance details, including network settings and storage.
Add a security group allowing inbound access on port 8080 (Jenkins default port) and port 22 (for SSH access).
Review and launch the instance, downloading the key pair for SSH access.
Access the EC2 Instance:
SSH into the instance using the downloaded key pair.
Install Jenkins on EC2 Instance

Install Dependencies:
Update the package manager and install Java (a prerequisite for Jenkins).
Set Up Jenkins Repository:
Add the Jenkins repository to your package manager and import the repository key.
Install Jenkins:
Install Jenkins using the package manager.
Start and Enable Jenkins:
Start the Jenkins service and enable it to run on system boot.
Configure Jenkins Setup

Access Jenkins Web Interface:
Open a web browser and navigate to http://<EC2-Instance-Public-IP>:8080.
Complete the initial Jenkins setup by unlocking Jenkins (retrieve the initial admin password from the server) and setting up the admin user.
Install suggested plugins.
Configure Jenkins Credentials

Create AWS Credentials in Jenkins:
Go to Jenkins dashboard > Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials.
Add a new set of credentials for AWS (access key ID and secret access key).
Configure GitHub Integration

Configure GitHub Credentials:
In Jenkins, navigate to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials and add GitHub credentials.
Create a New Jenkins Job:
Create a new "Freestyle project" job and configure it to pull code from your GitHub repository. Use the GitHub credentials added earlier.
Define CI Pipeline Stages

Build Stage:
Configure the build process, specifying how Jenkins should compile or interpret your application (e.g., a sample Python file or Java project).
Test Stage:
Configure automated tests to run after the build. This could include unit tests, integration tests, etc.
Deploy Stage:
Describe the deployment process to an EC2 instance.
Set up SSH credentials in Jenkins for the deployment target EC2 instance.
Use shell/batch scripts or a ready deployment plugin to automate the deployment to the EC2 instance.
Configure Build Triggers

Set Up Automatic Builds:
Configure Jenkins to trigger builds automatically on code changes by setting up webhooks from GitHub (in the Jenkins job configuration, under "Build Triggers", select "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling").
Run and Test the Pipeline

Initial Run:
Manually trigger the first build to ensure everything is configured correctly.
Monitor the build process in the Jenkins console to identify and resolve any issues.
Subsequent Runs:
Verify that the pipeline runs automatically on subsequent code changes.
Commit and Document Changes

Commit Changes Locally:
Commit your pipeline configurations and scripts to your local Git repository.
Push Changes to Remote Repository:
Push your changes to the remote repository to enable CI/CD for team collaboration.
Document the Setup:
Thoroughly document the steps, configurations, and any additional notes in a file named aws-ci-setup.md.
Create a Pull Request

Create Feature Branch:
Push your feature branch (feature-aws-ci) to the remote repository.
Create Pull Request (PR):
Create a PR to merge feature-aws-ci into the main branch, ensuring all configuration and documentation are reviewed before final integration.
By following these steps, you will establish a robust and optimized CI pipeline using Jenkins on AWS that can handle competitive programming test cases effectively.
